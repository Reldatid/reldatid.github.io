        <h2>Neural Network Analysis Tool</h2>
        <p>
          This was my final project at General Assembly. I wanted to create something I might use, and this was something I'd desired in the past. I created a rails database to archive data from running a genetic algorithm, and then used some javascript libraries to graph that data is various ways, including having a visual representation of the neural network itself.

        <h2>Tic-Tac-Toe ad Nauseam</h2>
        <p>
          As our first project at General Assembly, we were required to implement tic-tac-toe in the browser. I wanted to push myself and have enjoyed playing a variant called "Tic-Tac-Toe-Ten" with friends. Basically its a more tactical game based off regular tic tac toe where you nest 9 boards in one big board. I took it a step further and allowed the player to decide how many times to nest boards withing boards.(within reason) <br>

        <h2>World Tracker</h2>
        <p>
          The core idea behind this app was keeping track of information over many sessions in a table-top RPG. The biggest challenge here was finding a way to have associtions of flexible depth, because some games happend only in one world, but others are on a more galactic scale.   <br>

    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

      <p>
        Hey, I'm Jonathan. <br>
        Iâ€™m an aspiring Web Developer with an engineering background. I have a passion for programming and creating tidy, clever solutions to problems. I love playing music and singing, building toys for my niece (cough*me*cough) and playing any kind of game; table-top or computer based.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first time I actually coded anything myself was in Minecraft, using 'turtles' to automate simple repetitive tasks. It wasn't long until I was taught how to program properly at University when I started a Mechatronic Engineering degree. I got hooked, and was immediately using what I'd learned to create (very) simple physics simulations and little space-ship flying games.
      </p>
      <p>
        As much as I enjoyed the content, I found the University teaching style slow and impersonal, so when I found General Assembly and enquired about their programs it sounded perfect. I took the plunge and enjoyed the entire experience immensely.
